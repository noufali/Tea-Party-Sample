# Tea-Party-Game

Tea Party is a Unity game that was a part of a pop up window display featured @ Broadway & 10th St from Nov 15th 2017 to Nov 19th 2017. 

A user approached our window and activated a touch sensor that would then send a value to Arduino. This value was then sent  to the Unity game in order to activate a certain animation. Based on what value the user received, each animation would be different. 

This repository is a sample of the code that was written to control each scene change.

### Tools Used
